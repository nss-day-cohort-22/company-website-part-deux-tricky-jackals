    <!-- customer reviews -->
    <article> Some reviews from our customers: I can't speak highly enough about the attentive staff at Jackel Audio. They were so helpful in a last minute order for some extra mics and speakers for a tour date that was thrown on the band last minute. They came through with providing all of the equipment needed and I would recommend them to anyone in the industry",
